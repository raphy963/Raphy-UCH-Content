# Raphy's UCH Content
This is the content that was hosted on my Ultimate Chimera Hunt server back in 2014-2017

# Important notice
Most of (if not all of) the files have been downloaded from Reconstructed Ultimate Chimera Hunt. The clientside lua files have been "sniffed" and I edited out the content that wasn't rightfully mine. The method I applied, which will be explained in the near future, has not been done with fradulent intent nor did I used any "hacks" or some sort to get into the server and steal the files. All of this are files that are automatically downloaded by the Garry's mod client.

Should you notice any content that isn't rightfully mine or wasn't used in any forms on my server back then, please get in touch with me. Contact me on discord at Raphy#5335 or join my old discord from back then and tag me (https://discord.com/invite/UqwXQam)


# More info soon
